# IoT fun
Nothing special here, just tracking my personal experiments in IoT (ESP8266, NodeMCU, etc).

You may wish to take a look at https://github.com/smartynov/nodemcu-modules where I publish my ready to use modules for NodeMCU.

Should you have any questions, please concact me at email sergey@martynov.info, facebook or linkedin.
